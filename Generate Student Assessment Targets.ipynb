    "This method calculates target scores for all grade levels 3 to 8, and all starting scores from 100 to 350. Starting weeks of instruction were set to 2, and weeks of instruction at time of winter assessment were set to 16. I do not have access to the exact assessment date for each student, so weeks of instruction was based of the date 1/9/2018, which is the midpoint in the CPS district winter assessment window (12/11/2017 - 01/26/2018). Students do not take a fall assessment unless they have no prior year spring assessment on record. Regardless of actual baseline assessment date, performance will be assessed on the targets calculated here."
